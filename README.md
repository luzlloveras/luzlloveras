Hi, I’m Luz.

I’m a backend-focused developer working mainly with SAP CAP and Node.js, currently expanding into modern JavaScript and API-driven architectures.

I enjoy building small, clear systems that solve concrete problems and are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Now
- Working with SAP CAP (Node.js) on service-oriented applications
- Building backend APIs with Node.js and MongoDB
- Exploring cleaner project structure and documentation for real-world use

## Selected projects
- **incident-tracker-sap-cap**  
  Incident tracking service built with SAP CAP, focused on clear domain modeling and service separation.

- **payment-tracker-sap-cap**  
  Simple payment tracking backend using SAP CAP, designed to keep business logic explicit and readable.

- **nest-authentication-service**  
  Authentication service built with NestJS using JWT access and refresh tokens.

- **mongo-node-api**  
  Lightweight Node.js API using MongoDB, focused on clean structure and straightforward data access.

## What I care about
- Clear code over clever abstractions
- Small, understandable services
- Documentation that explains intent, not tutorials

I’m interested in backend or full-stack roles where code quality, ownership, and learning matter.
