## Profile

I design and build cloud-based applications with a focus on architecture, integration, and usability.

## Frontend / full-stack work (outside SAP)

I’m expanding into modern frontend and full-stack development with a focus on maintainable code, performance, and UI consistency.

Current focus areas:
- React and Next.js (App Router, Server Components)
- Tailwind CSS for layout and responsive design
- TypeScript for clearer boundaries and safer components
- Image-heavy interfaces (portfolios, optimization, aspect ratios)
- Modern deployment workflows and CI/CD fundamentals

**Hands-on project**
- **Photography portfolio (Next.js)**  
  Real-world project focused on visual storytelling, navigation clarity, and performance-oriented frontend architecture.  
  Repository: `photography-portfolio`

## Perspective

My background in photography and design influences how I approach software: clarity, hierarchy, and intent matter as much as clean code and solid architecture.
