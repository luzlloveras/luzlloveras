## 👩‍💻 About me

Professional SAP Business Technology Platform Developer with strong experience delivering end-to-end enterprise solutions using SAP CAP, Fiori, CDS, RAP, MDK, and SAP Build.

## 🧭 Professional Expansion · Frontend / Full-Stack (Outside SAP)

Alongside my enterprise SAP background, I’m intentionally expanding my technical scope into **modern frontend and full-stack development**, outside the SAP ecosystem.

This expansion is driven by product thinking, UX depth, and long-term technical autonomy — not by trends or career resets.

### Focus areas
- ⚛️ **React & Next.js** (App Router, Server Components, routing architecture)
- 🎨 **Design systems & layout engineering** (Tailwind CSS)
- 🧠 **TypeScript at scale** (typing strategies, component boundaries)
- 🖼 **Image-heavy interfaces** (performance, responsive layouts, aspect ratios)
- 🚀 **Modern deployment workflows** (Vercel, CI/CD mindset)

### Hands-on, production-minded work
- 📸 **Photography Portfolio (Next.js)**  
  A real-world project focused on visual storytelling, clean navigation, and performance-oriented frontend architecture.  
  Repository: `photography-portfolio`

### Positioning
I approach frontend and full-stack work with the same discipline I apply to enterprise systems:  
**architecture first, clarity over complexity, and design as a technical responsibility.**

## 🎨 Beyond engineering

Photography and design are not hobbies for me — they actively inform how I think about interfaces, composition, hierarchy, and user perception.

Blending aesthetics with solid engineering is part of my professional identity.
