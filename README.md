## 🧭 Professional Expansion · Frontend / Full-Stack (Outside SAP)

I’m expanding my skill set toward modern frontend and full-stack development, with a clear focus on **production-ready code**, **design systems**, and **performance**.

### Current focus
- ⚛️ **React & Next.js** (App Router, Server Components)
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** (layout engineering, responsive design)
- 🧠 **TypeScript** (component boundaries, typing strategies)
- 🖼 **Image-heavy interfaces** (portfolios, aspect ratios, optimization)

### Hands-on work

  A real-world project focused on visual storytelling, clean navigation, and performance-oriented frontend architecture.  
  Repository: `photography-portfolio`

## 🎨 Perspective

Photography and design strongly influence how I think about software: composition, hierarchy, and clarity are as important to me as clean code and solid architecture.
